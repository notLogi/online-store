## Online Store
The Online Store allows users to browse the vendor's available items and the amount for every item available. Also allows users to store items in a cart so they can check out their items.


## User stories
- As a user, I want to list the vendor's inventory, so I can see what they have for sale.
- As a user, I want to list my cart, so I can see what I am going to buy.
## Some features include:

**Add items to cart**
- Users are able to add items to the cart

**Viewing the vendor's inventory**
- View items available on the store

**Price and final price**
- Price is automatically calculated with all items in cart, allowing easy and smooth transactions.

## Interesting Part of my Code:
- An interesting part of my code is removing an element, because if you use a map, you need to use iterators. Had to look up a way to remove a K/V without using a for loop.
